## Minitalk Project
-- The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

- We must create a communication program in the form of a **client** and a **server**.
- The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
- The client takes two parameters:
	* The server PID.
	* The string to send.
